In the above code, we are extracting the sensor values from the sensor data string and applying the sensitivity factors to them. We then check the adjusted sensor values against the respective threshold values and activate or deactivate the relay module channels accordingly.

If the air pollution value is greater than the air pollution threshold, we turn on the first relay module channel. If the CO value is greater than the CO threshold, we turn on the second relay module channel. If the values are below the thresholds, we turn off the respective channels.

The getValue() function extracts the value of a particular sensor parameter from the sensor data string by searching for the separator character and then returning the substring between the previous and current separator. We then convert this string to an integer using the toInt() function.

In the setup function, we initialize the serial communication with the TCS TUS-100 sensor and set the pin modes for the relay module channels. We also turn off the relay module channels initially.

Finally, in the loop function, we read the sensor data from the serial port and perform the necessary checks on the sensor values.
